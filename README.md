# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, has given a list of tasks (shown below) to complete for the election audit of a recent local congressional election. These tasks are normally done in Microsoft Excel but Tom's manager would like to automate the process using Python. If the code is successful, they would like to expand the usage for senatorial districts and local elections. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
